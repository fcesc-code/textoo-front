## Continuous delivery
Automated testing in every pull request or merge to the main branch.
Automated code scanning to measure code quality, pull requests cannot be merged if quality is not met.
Automated security alerts for the repository.

## Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Alternatively, run npm start.

## Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.
Option npm run testAuto is given for GitHub Actions.

## Running end-to-end tests
Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor. Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.
