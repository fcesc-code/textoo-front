## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this is an open-source project for educational purposes, no support is granted. However, I am 
glad to hear feedback from any vulnerabilities or bugs in order to improve my coding skills.

To report any vulnerability or bug, just open an issue or eventually a pull request.
